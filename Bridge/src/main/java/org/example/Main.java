7. **Bridge Pattern:**
Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

/*
This example demonstrates how you can use the Bridge Pattern
to interchangeably use different drawing APIs (implementations)
with different shapes (abstractions).
The abstraction and implementation are decoupled,
allowing for flexibility and extensibility in the system.
